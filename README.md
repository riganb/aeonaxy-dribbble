Vercel Deployment Link: [https://aeonaxy-dribbble.vercel.app/](https://aeonaxy-dribbble.vercel.app/)

Notes:

- The usernames that the error 'already exists' would be shown for, are `Aeonaxy` and `Rigan`.
- I have made sure the website is responsive enough, tested on Google Chrome for the device Pixel 7.

- The project supports uploading profile picture on the second screen, and the same would be visible on the last screen at the top right corner.
- The project stores all the user data in a state variable inside the App component inside `App.tsx` file.
- The `types.tsx` file stores the types that have been used through multiple screens.
- The directory `screens` ðŸ“‚ stores the files for screens.

- I have also used 2 Google fonts, namely "Poppins" for the overall project, and "Cookie" for the cursive design of the font used for 'dribbble'.
- I have used `FontAwesomeIcon` wherever seemed necessary.
